## Writing test
To write your first test, create the file `uuv/e2e/first-test.feature` in the project root with the following content :
```gherkin title='uuv/e2e/first-test.feature'
Feature: Hello World

  Scenario: Search - Successful case
    When I visit path "https://e2e-test-quest.github.io/weather-app/"
    Then I should see a title named "Welcome to Weather App"
```
